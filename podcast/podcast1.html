        <p>How would you answer the question, "How's your mental health?'<br><br>

            If you watched the Olympics, you saw Simone Biles not only succeed wildly, but demonstrate to all the world
            how important maintaining her mental health has been to her. She talked openly about regular therapy
            sessions and the meditation practice that you could see her doing between competitions. Today we’re going to
            talk about the concept of mental health versus mental illness. It’s a crucial distinction – and one that I
            think a lot of people get mixed up. As Simone said of her departure from the Tokyo Olympics four years ago:
            “Nor do I have to explain why I put my health first. Physical health is mental health.”<br><br>

            The voicemail message for today is from someone whose mother wants to treat her still as if she were a child
            – and tries to maintain control over her now grown daughter. I’ll have some ideas… although I’m happy to
            report that she’s read some of my work and that has offered her an explanation of why she’s feeling the way
            she does.
