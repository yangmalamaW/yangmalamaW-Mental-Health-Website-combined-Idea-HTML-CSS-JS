        <p>This podcast episode focuses on the signs of depression and how to manage it with professional help and
            support systems.</p>

                <p>The Selfwork Podcast</p>

        <p>Sometimes the very decision on what to talk about here at SelfWork seems difficult, as the possibilities are
            endless really. And since May is Mental Health Awareness Month, I wanted to do something special – although
            any month is mental health awareness month for me! To help get me organized, I turned to an old teacher of
            mine who’s an internationally known expert on depression - Dr. Michael Yapko. I listened into one of his
            YouTube presentations on the current research in depression and what the best thinking is about its causes
            and its treatment. He mentions the five most common mental mistakes that can lead to depression or to a
            relapse.<br><br>

            So, this month in May, I’m going to present those to you; I’ll add in some of my own experiences and stories
            so that hopefully you can try and see if you’re making any of those mistakes – whether or not you consider
            yourself “depressed” or not.
