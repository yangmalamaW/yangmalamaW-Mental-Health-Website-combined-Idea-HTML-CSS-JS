                    <h2>Breaking the Stigma Around Mental Illness</h2>
                    <p>Mental illness affects millions of people worldwide, yet it remains one of the most stigmatized
                        issues in society. This stigma prevents many individuals from seeking the help they need and
                        fosters a culture of shame and silence. Breaking this stigma is essential to creating a more
                        compassionate, understanding world where mental health is treated with the same importance as
                        physical health.</p>
